# Dario Rebuild — Live Fix Log

Append-only chronology so a context summary never loses the thread.
Goal: each of the 7 forces excited only by its own trigger (diagonal dominates,
4-gate honest), code raised to the claim — no metric-gaming, no retreat.
Branch: `main` (`~/q/dario`, origin ariannamethod). Backup: frozen `legacy` = bdacb6a.
Spec: `REBUILD_PREREG.md` (4-gate, density-neutral metric, control arms, no gain-tuning).
Harness: `./dario --matrix` (gated `g_matrix_mode`, deterministic reset/cell, raw
pre-renorm energy `g_raw_energy`, snapshot `g_snap`, 6 triggers + 2 control + orthogonality).

## 4-gate (per force X)
1. specificity: act_X(trig_X) > act_X(trig_Y) ∀Y, margin ≥1.5×
2. within-argmax: X is the argmax force inside trig_X's own response
3. causation: act_X(trig_X) > baseline_X (control), margin ≥1.5×
4. token-delta: fix changes WHICH tokens respond, not just gain

## Chronology

**E0.5 — harness + reachability** (commits 92e59ec, cb7e123, 8ba12fd)
- Built `--matrix` harness; measurement-only, normal generation untouched.
- Reproducibility gate: found+fixed `rng_state=time(NULL)` (dario.c:1771) → deterministic
  per-cell seed. Two processes → identical matrix. PASS.
- CTRL fix: CTRL_empty read stale energy (no compute) → CTRL_minimal feeds "the".
- Orthogonality: corr(A/H/F/V) all |r|<0.20 (max 0.184) << 0.70 → **forces separable,
  goal reachable.** Audit's non-separability fear refuted.
- Baseline (unfixed): no force passes causation; forces are always-on-on-presence.

**E1 — root causes** (verified, file:line)
- B=`bigram_row(last)` (1275): last-token only · H=`Σcooc·dist` (1293): cooc richness ·
  F=prophecy_add every gen-token (1645): always-on-on-content · A=destiny EMA (1331):
  fills from any word · V=visual (1352): no visual signal in text · T=trauma gate (1341):
  seasonal-artifact, not trigger.

**E2 — decouple by orthogonal input features** (commits 007bf0b, f993f2f)
- **B**: last-token bigram → directional asymmetry `count(a→b)−count(b→a)` over window
  (1283). Responds to STRICT ORDER; symmetric recurrence cancels (=H's signal).
  B↔H decoupled at column level. STATUS: weak/noisy (B~3–4), does not cleanly lead its
  column yet — needs strengthening.
- **F**: prophecy added every gen-token (0.3) → flooded 300–440 everywhere, broke
  within-argmax for ALL. Now registers only on CONFIDENT prediction (cooc≥2, 1645).
  **Flood killed: 300–440 → 0–28.** STATUS: trigger is INDIRECT (driven by generation
  prediction dynamics, not input pattern) — re-derivation WIP.
- **H**: unchanged mechanism (symmetric cooc). With F-flood gone, H now passes 3/4 gates:
  H-trig H=133 = column max, 2.6× 2nd, 6.3× baseline(21), within-argmax ✓. CLOSEST to done.

**E2-H — H ISOLATED, first force done** (commit e977c58)
- Token-delta gate added to harness. Coherence verified PASS (generation still
  thematic/coherent after B/F changes; B/F are minor logit terms).
- H passes 4/4: specificity (133=col max, 2.6×), within-argmax, causation (6.3×
  baseline), token-delta (active set differs: measurement/observation vs
  saturation/hysteresis). Residual: H slightly elevated everywhere, margin clean.

**E2-B squared + generation-coupling diagnosis** (commits d26ca47)
- Squared the asymmetry (amplify strict order). B rose but still does NOT lead its
  column (B-trig 6.09 vs H-trig 6.33).
- ROOT DIAGNOSIS (precise): B is polluted by the organism's OWN generation. During
  process_input the generated tokens are appended to context (dario.c:1680) and
  `bigram_update(last, next, 0.5)` writes generation transitions (dario.c:1651).
  So the bigram table = input + generated, generation dominating. The input trigger
  cannot cleanly discriminate B. SAME class as F (generation-driven).

## Current state (after d26ca47)
- **H: DONE 4/4.** ✅ First force isolated, coherence intact.
- **B / F: generation-coupled** — their signal is mixed with the organism's own
  generation (bigrams 1651, context 1680; prophecy 1645). Input triggers don't
  cleanly discriminate them. FIX (deep): token-provenance — track input→input
  transitions separately from generated ones; B/F read only the input view.
- A / V / T: not addressed.
- Triggers in harness: EXPERIMENTAL, not frozen (freeze at E3).
- Coherence: provisional PASS (smoke); rigorous before/after-vs-legacy diff at E3.

**E2-B — B ISOLATED via token-provenance** (commit ccf1c61) ✅ SECOND FORCE
- Added `g_input_bigrams`: input-only bigram table (written from input transitions in
  context-update, cleared per cell). B reads directional asymmetry directly from it,
  independent of the context window (whose tail is generated tokens).
- Result: B-trig B=125 = col max, 5× 2nd (25), baseline 0.00, within-argmax (125>H46),
  token-delta trivial. **4/4.** B↔H cleanly decoupled. Provenance method VALIDATED.

**E2-F — F ISOLATED via provenance** (commit bbc2649) ✅ THIRD FORCE
- `g_input_debt`: debt of CONFIDENT input predictions the input itself violated
  (confident a→b, then a→c ⇒ debt[b]). F reads it; generation-prophecy kept for gen.
- F-trig ('alpha bravo×4 then alpha zulu') F=24, ZERO on every other trigger + baseline.
  Raw H=25.66 marginally over F=24, but under FROZEN per-force z-score metric F z=+2.2
  dominates (V+0.95 A+0.68 H−0.7 B−0.5). 4/4 under frozen metric. Provenance validated x2.

**E2-A — honest finding, NOT isolated** (commit c22fa87)
- Embeddings are RANDOM hashes of token id (get_embed:732) — no semantic relation.
  So A's "semantic destiny/compass" is unfounded (same class as Result-1 lie).
- A's real signal = destiny MAGNITUDE (focus). But weak & H-coupled: 'echo×5' →
  A=19.79 (col max, only 1.14× 2nd) while H=177 dominates the row. within-argmax fails.
- A needs mechanism rethink OR honest re-characterization; **paper2 must correct A's
  semantic framing** (another honesty fix alongside Result-1 + §5.1).

**E2 A+H+V — diagonal dominates B,H,F,A** (commit daa8f0a) ✅ FOUR FORCES
- A (destiny): random embeddings → 'semantic compass' unfounded. Honest A = thematic
  attractor via INPUT concentration (g_input_freq, freq²/total). A-trig=25 col max
  (1.67×), baseline 1 (25×), within-argmax clean (others 0). 4/4.
- H provenance: was D.cooc (gen+self polluted). Now g_input_cooc (input DISTINCT pairs,
  self excluded). echo→H=0, H-trig=56.76 col max, baseline 0. Properly clean now.
- V honest-inactive: get_vis_embed random hashes, vis_context fed by TEXT → V was noise.
  g_visual_input flag (default 0): text-only → V=0, placeholder like S. (paper: V needs visual.)
- Pushed: 14 commits bdacb6a..919df54 to origin main; then daa8f0a.

## State (after daa8f0a): B ✅ H ✅ F ✅ A ✅ — 4/6 isolated, diagonal dominates
- Each trigger makes its force row-argmax AND column-max. Clean.
- V, S: honest placeholders (no visual / subword inactive in this run).
- T (trauma): dissonance/alien — driver = compute_dissonance (1069, unknown-word ratio).
  NEXT: provenance accumulate input-dissonance (g_input_dissonance at 1941), T reads it.
- Paper2 honesty fixes accumulating: Result-1 (L1 artifact), §5.1 (SARTRE/KK),
  A (random-embedding semantics), V (random-embedding visual). All ≠ "downgrade".

## NEXT
A: respond to semantic coherence via destiny magnitude (if embeddings meaningful).
Then V (honest status), T (dissonance gate). Then full matrix 4-gate simultaneous +
coherence diff vs legacy + freeze triggers in pre-reg + E4 (polygon/runpod + paper2).

## Next
1. Finish H: token-delta gate + coherence (generation intact). Close first force fully.
2. Strengthen B (asymmetry too weak).
3. A / V / T same recipe (orthogonal-feature mechanism + derived trigger).
4. Full matrix 4-gate simultaneous + coherence.
5. E4: re-run on polygon (x86) / runpod, then Dario paper 2 (corrected numbers,
   "prior was false" AFTER the fix, §5.1 SARTRE/KK honesty). legacy = "what was".

**E2-T — T ISOLATED, DIAGONAL DOMINATES** (commit cae03ae) ✅ FIVE FORCES
- T via dissonance provenance: g_input_dissonance += compute_dissonance/turn (1942).
  Alien input -> high dissonance -> T; known -> low. T-trig gibberish, control = known
  bootstrap words. T-trig=127.50 col max (3.1×), within-argmax (127>B20), causation 5×.
- FULL DIAGONAL: B=125 H=56.90 F=24 A=25 T=127.50 — each its row+col max. V/S honest
  placeholders. Coherence smoke PASS (thematic clusters).
- GOAL REACHED for all active forces via provenance + orthogonal-feature decoupling.

## State (after cae03ae): B✅ H✅ F✅ A✅ T✅ — diagonal dominates, V/S honest placeholders
## Remaining: token-delta rigor per force · coherence diff vs legacy · freeze triggers in
## pre-reg · E4 (polygon/runpod re-run + Dario paper 2 with honesty fixes: Result-1 L1,
## §5.1 SARTRE/KK, A/V random-embeddings). legacy = "what was".

**E3 — coherence-diff vs legacy: PASS**
- Built frozen legacy (bdacb6a) in a worktree; generated same 3 prompts on legacy vs
  current. Both produce coherent thematic concept-clusters (legacy "trauma wound scar
  healing"; current "noise destiny collapse bifurcation"). Clusters differ (mechanisms
  changed -> different logits) but coherence QUALITY preserved — no degradation/garbage.
- The rebuild isolated the forces without breaking Dario's generation. Regression gate PASS.

**E3 — token-delta: B/A direct, H/F/T via matrix** (commit pending)
- token-delta dump extended to 5 forces. B-trig->two, A-trig->echo (trigger-specific,
  direct pass). T-trig->origin words (by design). H/F read 0 in dump (snapshot timing
  artifact) — their trigger-specificity is via column dominance in the matrix.
- E3 status: diagonal dominates (5 forces) + coherence PASS + token-delta (B/A direct,
  H/F/T via matrix). Rebuild core COMPLETE.

## E4 (next): freeze triggers in pre-reg · re-run on polygon (x86) / runpod · Dario paper 2
## (corrected numbers + honesty fixes: Result-1 L1, §5.1 SARTRE/KK, A/V random-embeddings).

**E4 — independent x86 re-run on polygon: BYTE-IDENTICAL** ✅
- Cloned/built dario on polygon (x86_64 Linux, different OS/compiler, independent node).
- Matrix reproduced EXACTLY: B=125 H=56.90 F=24 A=25 T=127.50 — identical to Intel/darwin.
- Closes the pre-reg independent-re-run binding. Diagonal-dominates is a reproducible,
  cross-platform, independently-verified fact, not a local artifact.
- Triggers FROZEN in REBUILD_PREREG.md.

## E4 remaining: Dario paper 2 (second edition) — corrected matrix + honesty fixes
## (Result-1 was L1-artifact; §5.1 ran with SARTRE/KK; A/V relied on random-hash embeddings;
## V/S honest placeholders). "Prior was false" stated AFTER the rebuild, not instead of it.

**E4 — Opus audit of Result-1 v2 draft: found вши (caught BEFORE publication)**
- KILLER: draft showed RAW energies but claimed "row argmax under frozen metric" — in raw,
  F<T (24<38.3), table contradicts claim = edition-1's exact structural error, repeated.
- Also: V row omitted (V-trig fires T=40.8,B=21), only CTRL_minimal shown (CTRL_filler T=46.4),
  token-delta over-claimed (direct only B/A), causation-on-unfixed unverified, closer too strong.
- RIGHT: L1-root, random-embedding finding, generation-coupling, B/A/T columns, orthogonality
  |r|≤0.236, refuse-to-retract — all genuinely honest.
- FIX: rewrite draft to show z-score (the real gate). Verified within-argmax DOES hold under
  per-force z-score for all 5 (F-trig F z=2.6 max; T-trig T z=2.4 max) — raw just hides it
  because force scales differ. Show z, both controls, V/S rows, honest token-delta, disclose
  synthetic+vocab+orthogonality. Numbers finalized from RunPod Phase-1.

## RUNPOD_PLAN.md written — all on RunPod, with plan/run/edition checklists. Next: Codex pre-audit.

**E4 — RunPod provisioning attempt (learning logged)**
- Provisioned via polygon (runpodctl 2.2 + SDK 1.9 + RunPod-Key-Go). CPU community pod
  `ys9pjkunk6ipat`, 2 vCPU/4GB, $0.06/hr, US-NC-1, RUNNING.
- BUT: CPU community pods don't map a direct TCP ssh port (RunPod routes their ssh via
  console proxy, not a public IP:port). Terminated immediately — no volume, nothing built,
  zero lost, no idle billing.
- NEXT for the full RunPod re-run: use a GPU pod (reliable direct ssh) OR RunPod console
  ssh-proxy from polygon. The equation re-run is cheap either way (~$1-2).
- NOTE: the matrix (Result 1, core of v2) is ALREADY double-verified — Intel macOS +
  polygon x86_64 Linux, byte-identical. RunPod adds platform parity + Results 2-8 re-run.

**E4 — RunPod A100 run (parity platform) + regression caught & fixed** ✅
- Provisioned A100-SXM4-80GB SECURE (same platform as v1!), ssh via id_ed25519_polygon.
- Phase 1: matrix reproduced byte-identical on A100 — B125 H56.90 F24 A25 T127.5, both
  controls, V/S=0, corr(A,H)=0.236, token-delta B→two/A→echo. THIRD platform (Intel +
  polygon + A100), and the A100 is v1's exact platform.
- Regression: make test = 1779/1780, fail = test_trauma_term ("high trauma → T>0").
  Cause: T was decoupled from trauma_level (now reads g_input_dissonance). HONEST FIX
  (not test-gaming): T responds to BOTH — input-dissonance (provenance, trigger-specific)
  AND accumulated trauma_level (origin pull, original behavior). Both dissonance-rooted.
- After fix: matrix still isolates (T-trig T=162.44 col max), make test = 1780/1780.
- A100 pod stopped (no idle billing). ~$1.40 total.

**E4 — HONEST gap: full run NOT yet done.** The A100 run did only: build + Result-1 matrix
+ make test (caught regression). It did NOT run Results 2-8 (chambers/velocity/laws/SARTRE/
KK/sampling/chain) or the organism's actual GENERATION behavior. The force rebuild changed
B/H/F/A/T, so downstream (generation, chambers, laws, KK) may have shifted — must be MEASURED,
not assumed. Re-provisioning A100 for the FULL run (build all + tests/*.sh R2-8 + generation
samples + coherence), capture to runpod/2026-06-02/.

**E5 — FULL run on A100 (vto66qir637tqz), Phase 2+3.** Matrix byte-identical (T=162.44
with trauma fix), tests 1780/1780. Results 2-8 harnesses BLOCKED: pod missing `jq`
(servers started 3101-3108 but response-parse failed) — NOT measured. Generation: organism
speaks; rebuilt B dominates live chamber readout (B:552 H:2 F:0 A:8 V:0 T:44) — downstream
effect of B=directional-asymmetry² raw scale, must be characterized vs legacy in Phase 3.
Singularity fix: install jq, re-run harnesses only.

**E6 — Phase 2 COMPLETE (jq installed) + archive pulled, pod removed (no idle billing).**
Results 2-8 on rebuilt code, honest held/changed:
- R8 visual (test_08): term_V_mean=0, vis_mean=0 across all 30 turns — V honestly INACTIVE in
  live operation, not just in the matrix. Confirms placeholder claim on a real run.
- R3/R5/R7 dominant-force histogram: T:trauma leads live (velocity 42/60, kuramoto 40/60,
  prophecy 184/200), then B:chain. Rebuilt T (raw 162) + B lead by raw scale.
- R6 KK (test_04): directional — unrelated input → more prophecy debt (31.3) than topical
  (18.2); fulfil_mean=0 on short runs.
- R4 seasons (test_03): 500 turns reached spring+1 summer only (autumn/winter null) —
  laws-of-nature needs full 2000-turn run; this undersampled.
- test_06/08 final formatting hit `column: command not found` (like jq) — data intact in jsonl.
PAPER-RELEVANT: matrix isolates forces under z-score (R1 ✓), but LIVE the high-raw-scale forces
T and B lead the chamber readout, A (destiny) does NOT. Reversal holds in matrix AND live.
Archive: runpod/2026-06-02/ = runpod_matrix_a100.txt + 8×*.jsonl + full_run.log + results_2_8.log.
STILL OPEN: Phase 3 coherence diff vs legacy (bdacb6a) — generation runs & organism speaks,
but not yet diffed against legacy to claim "no degradation". Then Codex post-audit, then write v2.

**E7 — COMPREHENSIVE A100 run (apwkzu9e40moqb), Phases 1-5, fix-on-spot.** Tools pre-installed
(jq+column), both versions built (rebuilt 78d101f 182512B, legacy bdacb6a 177992B). HEAD GEM:
head-to-head coherence on 40 identical neutral prompts — LEGACY dominant = A:destiny 29/40
(reproduces "Destiny Dominates"); REBUILT dominant = B:chain 27/40, A:destiny 0/40. The original
claim is real-in-code, artifact-in-mechanism: dominance vanishes when forces read input-provenance.
R4 laws-of-nature SURVIVES at full 2000-turn (β peak spring 0.311, α peak summer 0.352, τ 1.05→0.84).
Coherence preserved (resonance −9%, ent/emg within 5%; debt +123% as F tracks honest violations).
V inactive matrix+live (term_V=0). Synthesis: docs/dario_paper_v2_phase3_findings.md.
Artifacts: runpod/2026-06-02-comprehensive/logs/ (matrix + 10 jsonl + master.log). Pod removed.
NEXT: verification workflow (adversarial verify each claim vs jsonl + Codex 2nd opinion) → write v2.

**E8 — PLAN v2 + dual audit (Opus + Codex) + fixes.** RUNPOD_PLAN_V2_FULL.md = full 13-phase paper
protocol on rebuilt code (118fa98), nothing dropped (P5 SARTRE, P6 KK-injection, P7 540-cell sweep,
P8 chain/duet/trialogue model-to-model dialogue, P9 cross-arch duet re-inserted, P11 parity).
Opus plan-audit: FAIL-3-blocking (Phase 9 dropped / raw-vs-zscore "5 forces" / dario non-determinism)
+ CPU/GPU money split — all fixed. Background verify-workflow (7/7 claims recompute TRUE) + its
second-opinion caught the SAME вши in the findings doc: live dominance is RAW-argmax not z-gate;
per-TRIGGER own-force isolation STILL FAILS for F & V (T beats them on their own triggers); only 5/7
forces active; corr excluded B,T; n=40 no stats; T 1975/2000 long-run contradicts "no force dominates";
Phase-5 gen is canned template; "as legacy would produce" never measured. Codex review (codex-cli 0.136
reinstalled): 2 PASS on core (phase coverage + raw-vs-zscore fixed), FAIL-5 tightening (findings stale /
N=5 seed protocol / P12 numeric degradation rule / ablation commit-pin / pipefail) — all 5 applied.
Findings doc marked SUPERSEDED/INTERIM with the 10 audit caveats. NEXT: singularity execution per plan —
CPU phases on polygon ($0), A100 only P7/P9.

**E9 — P0 GREEN + P1 CORE DONE (singularity, polygon $0).** P0: 6 build configs (dario_kk_only SOFT-fails
= documented #ifdef coupling), infer_v4 OK, make test 1780/1780. P1: honest machine-emitted harness
(c77c6b2) reproduced on polygon. z-gate: B/H/F/A/T PASS, V FAIL (vacuous 0.00), S placeholder — 5 forces
isolate, not 7. per-trigger raw: F-trig→T FAIL, V-trig→T FAIL (v1 приговор for F/V unclosed at trigger
level — machine-visible now). corr ALL 6: corr(B,A)=0.845 COLLINEAR (decoupling NOT clean B↔A; was hidden
by excluding B,T), B↔H=0.444, rest ~0. Head-to-head stats (awk, Python-ban kept): McNemar b=29 c=0 exact
p≈3.7e-9 (reversal rock-solid); resonance sign-test 38/40 rebuilt<legacy z≈5.53 (systematic modest drop,
within pre-reg −0.15 threshold → "small systematic drop" not "preserved"). Ablation A1 DROPPED per pre-reg
(provenance+decoupling not separable). FINAL honest Result 1: docs/dario_paper_v2_result1_FINAL.md.
NEXT: P2 chambers (+R2 trauma-vs-dissonance sign check) on polygon, then P3-P6, then A100 for P7/P9.

**E10 — FULL RunPod run (A100 s8ipgidxanj1h8), held/changed per paper's 8 Results.** P0 GREEN
(6 configs, weights 3.5GB hf, test 1780/1780, infer_v4 after notorch+openblas install — singularity fix).
- **R1 Destiny Dominates → CHANGED (overturned).** Matrix reproduced on A100 (COUPLED): z-gate B/H/F/A/T
  PASS, V FAIL/vacuous, S placeholder (5 not 7); per-trigger F-trig→T & V-trig→T FAIL (v1 приговor
  unclosed at trigger level); corr(B,A)=0.845 COLLINEAR. Head-to-head McNemar p≈3.7e-9 (destiny 29/40→0/40);
  resonance sign-test 38/40 z≈5.53 (systematic modest drop).
- **R4 Laws of Nature → HELD.** 2000-turn, β-spring 0.311 / α-summer 0.352; (1−ent)×res identity.
- **R5 SARTRE Introspects → HELD (numbers identical).** Overlay base=84992B delta=16384B ratio=0.162 (=paper),
  3B tongue on 2TB host, 8-event ring, 3 modules. via /kernel command (not /stats).
- **R6 KK Scoring → HELD exactly.** Policy lexical=0.36 recency=0.12 trust=0.10 linkage=0.16 scope=0.10
  namespace=0.08 freshness=0.08 (=published). Recursive event reproduced: top hit for "resonance field" is
  the paper itself (dario_paper_draft_v4.md chunk 354). ingest needs a DIR not file.
- **R2/R3 → from comprehensive run (CHANGED toward T-dominance live).** R2 chambers co-activate; COMPLEX
  needs conversation (dialogue confirms).
- **R7 Sampling Is Architecture → BLOCKED on P0.5.** infer_v4 generates (~8s/cell, 540≈72min) but raw-prompt
  = word-salad even at champion 0.7/40 — SFT voices were TRAINED with chat-token wrapping (BOS/USER/ASST).
  Needs the P0.5 --chat-tokens patch (plan orders it before P7 for exactly this; I skipped it). Sweep killed.
- **R8 Multi-Turn Recovery → premise confirmed.** chain/duet/trialogue Go bins run (model↔model conversation);
  default sampling = degenerate attractor (yent repeats one segment) = Result 8's "default is bad". Recovery
  needs champion params + chat-tokens.
Artifacts: runpod/2026-06-02_full/{01_equation,05_sartre,06_kk,08_modes}. Pod ALIVE (weights+notorch on it).
NEXT: implement P0.5 chat-tokens on infer_v4 → re-sweep R7 + dialogue recovery R8.

**E11 — P0.5 chat-tokens FIX + R7 sweep COMPLETE.** infer_v4 --chat-tokens (BOS/USER/ASST wrap, stop
ASST_END, rep-penalty CLI) committed 81b43a6. Night-and-day: raw="The The Sw Sw sw" salad → chat="The
sound that when two people speak in the same language creates a pattern of resonance..." coherent.
540-cell sweep (chat-tokens for leo/arianna/yent, raw for resonance-yent/leo24m): 432 ok, 108 err
(=resonance-yent, §7 infer_v4 H<=16 vs H=20 bound CONFIRMED). Scored distinct-2 - 0.5*rep, avg over 3
prompts. **R7 verdict: THESIS HELD, exact champions DRIFTED.** "Sampling Is Architecture" holds — defaults
0.75/40 not top-3; optima = high temp + no top-k + high rep-pen (paper's direction). But claimed champions
rank #19(leo)/#7(arianna)/#22(yent)/#2(leo24m) of 36 under pure distinct-2 — proxy metric peaks at temp 1.0
while paper's human picked lower temp for coherence among top-distinct cells + seed variation. Honest:
direction confirmed, exact per-voice cells not re-derived by metric alone. Artifacts: 07_voices_scores.tsv,
transcripts/. NEXT: R8 dialogue recovery (chat-tokens+champions) + trialogue + forum + P10 web + P11 parity.

**E12 — R8 + dialogue modes DONE. All 8 Results verified on A100.** R8 chain recovery (leo, champion+
chat-tokens): 3 DISTINCT coherent turns, attractor basin broken (vs default=salad) → HELD. Model-to-model
DUET (leo<->yent) + TRIALOGUE (leo/yent/arianna) coherent, distinct on-voice registers — the "conversations
between models" surface works. Go dialogue binary spawns infer_v4 WITHOUT --chat-tokens (infer.go) → its
raw output was salad; demonstrated R8 directly via infer_v4+chat-tokens instead (same engine). FOLLOW-UP:
add --chat-tokens passthrough to cmd/internal/dario/infer.go. FINAL held/changed (all 8):
R1 CHANGED (overturned, McNemar p=3.7e-9, z-gate 5/7, corr(B,A)=0.845, coherence systematic-modest-drop) ·
R2 chambers co-activate, COMPLEX-needs-conversation shown via duet · R3 CHANGED (T-dominance) ·
R4 HELD (laws, 2000-turn) · R5 HELD (SARTRE numbers identical) · R6 HELD (KK policy exact + self-ingest) ·
R7 thesis HELD / exact champions DRIFTED (distinct-2 metric, §7 resonance bound confirmed) ·
R8 HELD (recovery). Archive runpod/2026-06-02_full/. Pod stopping. NOT done: forum/web(P10)/parity(P11) infra.
